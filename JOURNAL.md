When I noticed #black-box was fufilling prizes by giving everyone 3 MINI BREADBOARDS, I was perplexed to say the least. That's just so, so expensive and unprofessional. I actually really like the concept of black-box: 64 LEDs, 5 buttons, and a buzzer. Nothing more, nothing less. Simple and pleasant. The editor is also super nice and has so many features. But shipping out unpolished, expensive kits? Sounds like a disaster. I want to fix that. Maybe, I can mass produce this to make a v2. The editor should not go to waste. So... I got started.

I followed the wiring instructions in blackbox.hackclub.com/build to design the schematic. This type of project is super easy for me, as I've made far, far more complicated PCBs. However, it still took a long time to import the files (some of them wouldn't load for some reason) and to just follow the instructions. Here is what I got:

After that, I began work on the PCB. I just wanted to get a prototype out. For this reason, it was SUPER unpolished. Everything was off-center.

Next, I made the case. Again, super simple as I have done stuff like this before.

I showed off my work at this show n' tell call, hosted by @Goos. It was really cool seeing the other projects. When it was my turn to present, everybody liked it to an extent, but hated the fact it was off-center. Deep down, I felt the same way. Something had to be done. So... I ended up completely redesigning EVERYTHING (except the schematic, of course). At the end of this mid-life crisis /j, I got this as result for the PCB:

Finally, I had to redesign the case. All I had to do was change a couple of dimensions. I also added these somewhat random filets to make it feel a bit rounded. I went with an exposed aesthetic. Here is the final result:
