# black-box
Black Box was a YSWS program ran by @lux in 2025. The premise was simple: 64 LEDs, 5 buttons, and a buzzer. It was a YSWS about limitations. I absolutely LOVED the idea, but never got around to making a Black Box. When fufillment came around, all that was shipped to participants was three breadboards, a bunch of wires, and all the parts to assemble this. I was flabberghasted. All of this money going to breadboards? I knew something had to be done. I made a PCB for #black-box. Read JOURNAL.md for a more detailed story.
